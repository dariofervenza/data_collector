# DATA COLLECTOR
App made for an interview test, this is my first solution but I think I can do it better. It is supposed to collect data from an api, save it, display it in graphs and create alarms

I would like to create as my second solution an app client-server that uses web-sockets, pymongo, skforecast and pyqt. I will upload it as soon as I finish it. Stay tuned!
